When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Mainly, when collaborating with a team. But it is also useful to keep your work safe in case
	you computer/hard drive breaks and to keep your work organised. Also, you might want to share 
	your project with the public, to help others, to be helped by others and/or to contribute to 
	the open source community.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	Pulling changes from remote repositories is great, but it can also break your code, so, you
	probably want to update from a remote repo whenever you are ready to receive those changes
	and resolve any possible conflict resulting from the update/sync process.
