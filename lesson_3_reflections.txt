When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	Mainly, when collaborating with a team. But it is also useful to keep your work safe in case
	you computer/hard drive breaks and to keep your work organised. Also, you might want to share 
	your project with the public, to help others, to be helped by others and/or to contribute to 
	the open source community.
